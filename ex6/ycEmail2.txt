Hi AJ,

I've called before to cancel my renter's policy, effective 1/28/2017, because I moved away from the address 450 N Mathilda Ave M308, Sunnyvale.

Today, I got from mail the following document about renewing the above policy. When I log into statefarm.com, it still shows the renter's insurance (05-B6-D893-1).

Can you take a look and process the cancellation? Is there any refund associated with it?

Thanks!
