Hi Amy,
 
Can you check if the corporate mortgage benefit has been processed following the closing the loan?

Receive an award 
When eligible customers finance their home with Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, they'll receive instructions on how to redeem a My Mortgage GiftSM award after closing — $500 for buying a home, or $300 for refinancing — for use at participating retailers.1

Hi Amy,
 
I found that through my new employer LinkedIn, there is such a program with Wells Fargo:

I called the 800 number on the page and the representative said the program code can be added towards my application.
 
Thanks,
